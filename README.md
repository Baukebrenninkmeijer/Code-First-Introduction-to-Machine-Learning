# Intro to ML using Python

You can run the presentation the easiest by downloading the [slides](https://github.com/Baukebrenninkmeijer/Code-First-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning/blob/master/intro_to_ml_in_python.slides.html). Then you can run them in your browser.  

### Installation for running notebook
First, make sure you have installed python and pip, either with Anaconda or without.
Then, install with:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Then, open a terminal in the folder where you downloaded these files and run:
```
jupyter lab
```

You should then be able to open the notebook (.ipynb) file there.
